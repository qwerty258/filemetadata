# FileMetadata

file and metadata management

 - [ ] respect original file name and content integrity
 - [ ] regard every file as binary data
 - [ ] use sha1sum and size as integrity check
 - [ ] never trust cloud provider, local data is really mine but this doesn't prevent back up data to the cloud
 - [ ] import from friend's database
